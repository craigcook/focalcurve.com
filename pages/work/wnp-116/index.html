  <p>Firefox releases major version updates on a four week rapid-release cycle.
    The first time Firefox restarts after an update, it automatically loads a
    web page to let the user know the update was a success. They call it the
    “What’s New Page” (WNP) and it’s also a prime opportunity to highlight Firefox
    features or cross-promote other Mozilla products.</p>

  <p>For Firefox version 116.0, we wanted to tell users about Reader Mode,
    which strips a long-form page down to the essential content, hiding things
    like navigation, sidebars, and especially ads. It’s hard to understand what
    it does until you see it for yourself, so we wanted to somehow simulate the
    effect.</p>

    <source media="(max-width: 799px)" srcset="/assets/img/work/wnp-116/before-800.jpg" width="800" height="553">
    <source media="(min-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/work/wnp-116/before-1200.jpg" width="1200" height="829">
    <img loading="lazy" src="/assets/img/work/wnp-116/before-800.jpg" width="800" height="553" alt="Screenshot of the page before the animation.">
  </picture>

  <p>When the page loads it’s cluttered with extra junk, which is then swept away
    and you’re left with a clean, readable page. It’s a pure CSS animation and the
    extra elements are empty <code>div</code>s with no actual content.</p>

  <picture class="fc5-c-figure fc5-l-align-center">
    <source media="(max-width: 799px)" srcset="/assets/img/work/wnp-116/after-800.jpg" width="800" height="571">
    <source media="(min-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/work/wnp-116/after-1200.jpg" width="1200" height="856">
    <img loading="lazy" src="/assets/img/work/wnp-116/after-800.jpg" width="800" height="571" alt="Screenshot of the page after the animation completes.">
  </picture>

  <p>There’s an easter egg in the CSS, which I doubt anyone ever saw other
    than my teammate who reviewed the pull request; Two of the mock ads have
    solid bars representing text, but there is real text hidden in them. One
    reads “The 91 best clickbait listicles of the week so far. Number 36 will
    shock you!” and the other is “Lose weight fast by emptying your wallet!”</p>

  <p>Some things I do just for myself.</p>
