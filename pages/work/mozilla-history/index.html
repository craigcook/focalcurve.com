  <p>Mozilla was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Q7FTjhvZ7Y" title="Watch 'Project Code Rush,' a documentary film about the early days of the Mozilla Project, on YouTube" rel="external noopener">born at Netscape in 1998</a>
    with the public release of the Netscape source code. To celebrate the 15th
    anniversary of that beginning, we wanted to walk people through a timeline of
    15 milestones in Mozilla’s history, and do it with a bit of flair. So we made
    a fancy slide show. It’s perhaps a rare valid use-case for a carousel on a website.</p>

  <img class="fc5-c-figure fc5-l-align-center fc5-t-border" src="/assets/img/work/mozilla-history/history-800.jpg" srcset="/assets/img/work/mozilla-history/history-1200.jpg 1.5x" alt="Screenshot of the history slide show." width="800" height="480" loading="lazy">

  <p>This uses jQuery (hey, it was 2014) to step through the slides, but the actual
    motion is all pure CSS animation; jQuery essentially just toggles classes off
    and on and maintains the sequential order. If JavaScript isn’t available it
    defaults to a simplified list (also the default experience in smaller viewports
    where there isn't room for the slide transitions).</p>

  <figure class="fc5-c-figure fc5-l-align-center fc5-t-border">
    <img src="/assets/img/work/mozilla-history/nojs-800.jpg" srcset="/assets/img/work/mozilla-history/nojs-1200.jpg 1.5x" alt="Screenshot of the page as it appears when JavaScript is disabled, showing the content in a readable, linearized list." width="800" height="480" loading="lazy">
    <figcaption>How the page appears without JavaScript or in a smaller viewport.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>The slide show was only supposed to be on the site for a month, but people
    really liked it so it stayed in place far longer than intended. It was finally
    <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/bedrock/commit/d4a8ed0b8cb19a613e6cb3b086f0ee07abaaa16e">decommissioned in 2019</a>
    as we were gradually rebranding the entire site and there just wasn’t a place
    for it any more. I salvaged this copy from the
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140511045712/http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/history/">Wayback Machine</a>
    with a bit of cleanup.</p>
