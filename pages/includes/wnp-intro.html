<p>Firefox releases major version updates on a four week rapid-release cycle.
  The first time Firefox restarts after an update, it automatically loads a
  web page to let the user know the update was a success. They call it the
  “What’s New Page” (WNP) and it’s also a prime opportunity to highlight Firefox
  features or cross-promote other Mozilla products.</p>
