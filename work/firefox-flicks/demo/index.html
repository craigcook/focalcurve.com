While working for Atari as Director of Sales for the coin op division, owned by Warner Communications, he became friendly with Clint Eastwood who helped him secure his SAG card in 1982. Warner transferred him to Panavision in 1984 where he started as Director of Marketing. He became very involved with production from start to finish of principal photography. He is a member of the American Society of Cinematographers, a charter member of the IFP for independent films, a recipient of a FINDI award for his work with new and independent filmmakers and is thought of as a mentor to many successful filmmakers today.    &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
        Named the &quot;next big thing&quot; and one of the &quot;top 35 Latinos under 35,&quot; by &lt;cite&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/cite&gt;, Gina Rodriguez's profile has been rising steadily since her breakout performance as the titular character in &lt;cite&gt;Filly Brown&lt;/cite&gt; during the 2012 Sundance Film Festival. A 2012 Imagen award winner for &quot;Best Actress in a Feature Film: &lt;cite&gt;Filly Brown&lt;/cite&gt;,&quot; Gina is steadily noticed by the public and entertainment industry due to her incredible acting chops and infectiously joyful personality.    &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
        Growing up in Chicago, Gina Rodriguez started performing at age seven with the salsa dance company &lt;i&gt;Fantasia Juvenil&lt;/i&gt;. At sixteen, Gina was one of thirteen teens to be accepted into Columbia University New York - Theatrical Collaboration, taught by Richard Niles. She was accepted into the Tisch School of the Arts, and the calling was clear; theatre was it. After the years of success in New York, Gina booked a lead role in a feature film &lt;cite&gt;Go For It&lt;/cite&gt; (Lionsgate) in which she received a 2011 Imagen Awards nomination. After this, Gina booked her first co-star TV role on CBS' &lt;cite&gt;Eleventh Hour&lt;/cite&gt;. She went on to book series regular roles on web series &lt;cite&gt;Eden's Court&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;No Names&lt;/cite&gt;; her first studio film &lt;cite&gt;Our Family Wedding&lt;/cite&gt; with America Ferrera; and a lead in film &lt;cite&gt;Superchicas&lt;/cite&gt;. It was also recently announced that Gina has been cast in the highly coveted lead role of Pilar &quot;Maytag&quot; Robles in the Fox Navy drama pilot &lt;cite&gt;Wild Blue&lt;/cite&gt;.    &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
        Gina is a supporter of Inspira, an organization that works to spotlight Latino leaders who shape their communities. She also works with the National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts and the Boyle Heights Learning Collaborative. She lives in Los Angeles, California.    &lt;/p&gt;

Prior to Blumhouse, Samuelson produced the forthcoming Paramount release, &lt;cite&gt;Destination Wedding&lt;/cite&gt;. Made for $100,000, that film will be the lowest-budget feature produced and released theatrically by a major studio in the modern era. Samuelson began his career at Mark Cuban's 2929, where he co-produced movies including James Gray's &lt;cite&gt;We Own the Night&lt;/cite&gt; and &lt;cite&gt;Two Lovers&lt;/cite&gt;, both of which were nominated for the Cannes &lt;i&gt;Palme d'Or&lt;/i&gt;.    &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
        Louie Schwartzberg is an award-winning producer, director, and cinematographer whose notable career spans more than three decades providing breathtaking imagery for feature films, television shows, documentaries and commercials.    &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
        As a visual artist, Louie has created some of the most iconic and memorable film moments of our time. He is an innovator in the world of nature, aerial and &quot;slice-of-life&quot; photography &amp;ndash; the only cinematographer in the world who has literally been shooting time-lapse 24 hours a day, 7 days a week continuously for more than 30 years.    &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
        He recently completed &lt;cite&gt;Wings of Life&lt;/cite&gt;, a documentary feature for Disneynature, narrated by Meryl Streep. It won Best Theatrical Program at the Jackson Hole Science Media Awards 2012, a Best Cinematography Roscar Award, and the Best Cinematography Award at the 2013 Waimea Ocean Film Festival. The film reveals the fragile relationship between flowers, and their pollination partners. It is a love story that feeds the earth. The film will be released April 16 on Blu Ray. As a director, he is completing &lt;cite&gt;Mysteries of the Unseen World&lt;/cite&gt;, a 3D-IMAX film with National Geographic, that is targeted for an October 2013 release. The film is a journey into invisible worlds that are too slow, too fast, too small and too vast for the human eye to see. He has received Clio Awards for Best Environmental PSA, an Emmy nomination for Best Cinematography for &lt;cite&gt;Oceans of Air&lt;/cite&gt; on the Discovery Channel, and recognized as one of the top 70 Cinematographers for the On Film Kodak Salute Series.    &lt;/p&gt;

        Andrzej Szajna has been in and out of the film and TV industry for 19 years. He started his career as an assistant director on low budget action movies such as &lt;cite&gt;Avalon&lt;/cite&gt;, &lt;cite&gt;Derailed&lt;/cite&gt;, and &lt;cite&gt;Out of Reach&lt;/cite&gt; and worked for Independent producers such as Nu Image and Lucky 7 productions. At this point, Andrzej delved into stockbroking and entrepreneurship for 3 years. He went on to produce &lt;cite&gt;Snow White Russian Red&lt;/cite&gt; which won best film in 2010 at the Polish Eagle awards, as well as the Polish Hollywood Eagle awards. Afterwards, he produced &lt;cite&gt;Londoners&lt;/cite&gt;, a Polish TV series with a 13 million euro budget, which was nominated for Prix Europa and other awards internationally.    &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
        Andrzej has spent the last couple of years fund raising for non profit organizations and is currently developing a slate of new projects for 2014.    &lt;/p&gt;
